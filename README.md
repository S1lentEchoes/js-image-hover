# js-image-hover

A simple javascript function for changing an image's source on hover and exit.

As I stated in all my other repositories - The first thing that you will probably notice is that it is HEAVILY commented. This was intentional (yes, even to this extreme degree), mostly just for myself. I am still fairly new to coding, and multiple times in the past when I have gone back to some of my previous work I would always have a hard time understanding what my code meant. So along with relentlessly detailing everything that I was doing in the code, I also tried to capture the mindset that I had while I was coding it (or rather, why I coded it the way that I did).

This also has the added benefit of helping to remember this information without the need for comments - sort of like when you write something down to remember it, and the act of writing it down is what helped you remember it. With the only downside being the time taken to write the comments (since minifying removes all of the extraneous content), I saw no reason not to.

While this code is straightforward, it does require exact naming for any of the image's needed.  As I am still new to coding, I am not sure if there is a better way of doing this.  I say that because despite this working exactly as needed, and it not being overly complex, something just "feels off" about it.  Meaning, it feels like there is a better way of doing it even if I am not sure of how to do that.  I am always open to hearing advice.

This also requires event listeners to be set on the image(s) in quesiton. However you go about that is up to you.  Obviously this is not a huge deal if you only have a few images that you want to add this functionality to, but for a lot of images then event "bubbling" will probably be needed and some of that can start to get overly complex (at least for me, at this point in time).

I think that about covers it, any more code explanations that may be needed can easily be found inside the file's comments. I have included both the normal version, and the minified version.
